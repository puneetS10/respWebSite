                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Internet is increasingly being used for the delivery of
                    educational material and distance education. Internet-based learning allows students to learn at
                    their own pace, access the information at a time that is convenient for them, and provides education
                    to remote students that otherwise would not be able to travel to a classroom. Some courses available
                    on the Internet are delivered as a formal course with regular meeting times and places. Other
                    courses follow a self-directed or student centered approach allowing students to learn at a time and
                    pace that is convenient to them. Some institutions offer courses in a wide range of disciplines and
                    topics that can lead to a diplomas or degrees.</p>

                <p class="sectionTag text-big">Convenient Learning</p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">One of the most prominent trends in distance education is the
                    emergence of Open Learning, which has been defined as "a student centered approach to education
                    which removes all barriers to access while providing a high degree of learner autonotmy". The
                    Internet supports the open learning concept by providing students with the ability to connect to
                    educational resources when it is convenient for them, and allowing students to explore the
                    educational resources in an order that suits their needs. In an open learning environment the
                    teacher no longer serves as the keeper of knowledge. Instead the teacher acts as a tutor,
                    facilitator, and resource to assist in the student's learning process.

                    Each student has individual preferred patterns or methods for learning which need to be recognized
                    and supported with the appropriate learning technologies.</p>
